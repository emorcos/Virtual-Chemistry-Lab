# Virtual Chemistry Lab

## Overview

This project is a virtual chemistry lab designed to provide an accessible and affordable learning environment for students, particularly in resource-constrained settings. The lab simulates basic chemistry equipment and reactions, allowing users to experiment and explore chemical concepts without the need for expensive physical equipment.

## Features

*   Simulates basic chemistry equipment (reactors, distillation columns, etc.).
*   Allows users to select chemicals and define reaction conditions.
*   Provides a text-based user interface (UI) for interaction.
*   Uses simplified models to simulate chemical reactions.
*   Data-driven design: Equipment, chemicals, and reactions are defined in JSON files for easy modification and extension.
